			<h4>Transactions: The Central Elements of a Product</h4>
			<p>Transactions are <span class="bold">the</span> central <span class="keyword">resource</span> in an AgencyPort <span class="keyword">product</span>. Think of a <span class="keyword">transaction</span> as a bunch of pages strung together to accomplish a single business workflow (for example an insurance policy quote). Types of <span class="keyword">transactions</span> supported by AgencyPort products include New Business, Endorsements, Quick Quote, and Interview.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><span class="empahasis">Pages, Sections, and Fields</span></h4>
			<p><span class="keyword">Transactions</span> are made up of <span class="keyword">Pages</span>, <span class="example">(groups of logically related data collection fields, Applicant Information for example)</span>, which contain <span class="keyword">page elements</span> <span class="example">(i.e. sections of logically related information, i.e a mailing address)</span> which contain <span class="keyword">field elements</span> <span class="example">(the actual data collection fields, for example Address Line 1)</span>. Use the Transaction editor to configure all of these things.</p>
			<p class="hint"><span class="hint">Hint:</span> If you find yourself creating a page that you think you'll probably need to use again in a different <span class="keyword">transaction</span>, consider putting it in a <span class="keyword">page library</span> instead!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Include it All!</h4>
			<p>You'll frequently have fields which should only be conditionally displayed to the user, or whose properties might change depending on other data entered by the user. <span class="keyword">Behaviors</span> take care of that for you. Think of your transaction as the superset of all the fields possible. The moral of the story: Don't worry about conditionality here, include all your fields, and we'll get to those complex conditional inclusion/exclusion/alteration rules with behaviors.</p>
