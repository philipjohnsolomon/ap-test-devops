<div class="cover_text ${resourceType}_intro"><h3>${artifactTitle}</h3><ul><li><h4>About</h4><p>With the Work Item Assistant, users can add comments and file attachments to a <span class="keyword">page</span>, and see when other users are viewing the same work item. You can use the Toolkit to create different Assistants for different <span class="keyword">products</span>, or to implement a shared Assistant across multiple products.</p></li><li><h4>Sections: The Contents of the Assistant</h4><p>The Assistant is made up of three types of <span class="keyword">sections:</span> <strong>Comments,</strong> <strong>File Attachments,</strong> and <strong>Other Active Users.</strong> With the Toolkit you will configure the labels, order, and number of sections in your Assistant. You can have multiple Comments sections <span class="example">(i.e. "Agent Comments" and "Underwriter Comments")</span> and multiple File Attachments sections, but you'll only need one Other Active Users section per Assistant (if you want to add one at all).</p></li><li><h4>Roles</h4><p>You might want to limit which of your users can view and use certain sections of the Assistant. This access is based on the user's <span class="keyword">role name,</span> which you can define for each section. <span class="example">So for example, you could create one Comments section for agents, and one Comments section for underwriters.</span> Similarly, you might want to block agents from seeing that an underwriter is online and looking at a particular work item, so in this case you'd only show the Other Active Users section to internal company folks, not agents.</p></li><li><h4>One Last Step</h4><p>Once you create your new Assistant, you need to add it to your <span class="keyword">transaction</span>. Just select your transaction file from the navigation menu, and at the bottom of the palette, select the Assistant file you want from the "Work Item Assistant" drop down field.</p></li><li><h4>Don't Need the Assistant?</h4><p>You can turn off the Assistant inside a transaction by setting the "Work Item Assistant" field at the bottom of the palette to blank.</p></li></ul></div>
