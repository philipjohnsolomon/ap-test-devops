			<h4>Rules: The Underwriting Traffic Cop</h4>
			<p>The best analogy to use to describe the role that <span class="keyword">rules</span> play in your <span class="keyword">product</span> is that of a traffic cop. The primary purpose of a <span class="keyword">rule</span> is to help you to qualify the information entered by the user, and act on it accordingly. <span class="keyword">Rules</span> are used to generate informational, warning, or error messages for the user, and when coupled with <span class="keyword">instructions</span> can act to reassign or update the status of a work item. When you need to qualify eligibility of a work item, a <span class="keyword">rule</span> is the tool for the job!</p>
			<p class="hint"><span class="hint">Hint:</span> If you're trying to implement logic like "show this if..." or "make this required when...", you're probably in the wrong neighborhood! Head on over to the magical land of <span class="keyword">behaviors</span>!</p>

			<h4>Rules and Instructions</h4>
			<p>By themselves, rules generate messages as a part of their execution, but what if you need to act based on the outcome of a particular rule? This is where <span class="keyword">Instructions</span> come in. Instructions can do things like re-assign a work item or update its status. <span class="bold">Instructions and Rules come together on a page</span>. Use the <span>Page Library</span> or <span class="keyword">Transaction</span> editors to make the pairing.</p>
