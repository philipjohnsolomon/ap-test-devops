			<h4>Page Libraries: Sharing is Caring</h4>
			<p>If you have a product with more than one transaction, <span class="keyword">Page Libraries</span> give you the ability to share pages between them. Why create a page that collects an applicant name and mailing address twice? Create it once, in the <span class="keyword">page library</span>, then import it into the <span class="keyword">transactions</span> that use it! As you update and change your page definition, the transactions that use it will automatically be updated.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>A Page Library Page + Behaviors = Context Specific Variation</h4>
			<p>All this sharing stuff sounds nice, but what if the shared page actually needs to change a little bit depending on the transaction in which it's being used? <span class="keyword">Behaviors</span> make this variation possible. You'll be able to use behaviors to make alterations to your page before it is imported into a transaction. </p><p>In the <span class="keyword">Page Library</span> editor, try to design the prototypical version of the page, knowing you'll have the ability to add, remove, and change it when you actually import it.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>The Scope of a Page Library</h4>
			<p>Pages within the <span class="keyword">Page Library</span> will be available to transactions within the same product or any products which have expressed a dependency on this product. </p><p><span class="example">A little more about this <span class="keyword">dependency</span> stuff: You can create a product that's not actually a product at all, rather just a collection of shared stuff for use by other products. A common example would be creating a "Shared Commercial Lines" <span class="keyword">product</span>, and linking it to your GL, CPP, and Property <span class="keyword">products</span>.  Now you can share common lists, pages, and rules between them.</span></p>
