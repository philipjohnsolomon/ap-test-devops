			<h4>Complex Data Parsing Requirements? Views to the Rescue!</h4>
			<p>It's pretty straight forward to store user entered values when there is a one to one relationship between a field on a page and the underlying XML schema, but things get a little trickier when the relationship is more complex. <span class="keyword">Views</span> to the rescue! </p>

			<h4>Explode a Single Value Into Multiple XML Elements</h4>
			<p>When implementing a product, you might come across a case where multiple coverages are represented through a single user interface control. The quintessential example is split limits - one drop down list with the values like $100/$250 and $100/$500. When it comes time to put away the values and create the underlying XML coverage aggregates, a view will make this possible.</p>
